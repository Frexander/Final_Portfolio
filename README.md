For Problem 2 and 3 the files Task2.ipynb and Task3.ipynb can be run in GitHub respectively. For Problem 4 the files DQN_2_lay_targetN.ipynb and 
Q_learning_vs_SARSA.ipynb was programmed in Google Colab and copied into GitHub. The file PSO_VRPTW_alt3.ipynb was an initital flawed attempt 
for a solution for Problem 3 and should be disregarded as a part of the portfolio.
